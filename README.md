## Pac-Man

Pac-Man, originally called Puck Man in Japan, is a 1980 maze video game developed and released by Namco for arcades. In North America, the game was released by Midway Manufacturing as part of its licensing agreement with Namco America. The player controls Pac-Man, who must eat all the dots inside an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored ghosts. Eating large flashing dots called "Power Pellets" causes the ghosts to temporarily turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points.

This project intents to hold the most perfect arcade port of the 1980's arcade game Pac-Mac to the Agon Light 2 possible, within the limitations of the platform.

Controls will be either by keyboard or via the [EIGHTSBITWIDE Arcade board](https://andymccall.co.uk/electronics/retrocomputing/agon/basic/2024/07/09/agon-light-2-arcade-controller-board.html).
